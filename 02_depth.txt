Git internal

every commit gets an unique id which is AKA as sha id
every hash is dependent on the previous one like
linked list in stack

this is how git works behind the scene
everything in git is based on objects

everytime when you make certain changes in git it stores 
it like snapshot

there are 3 pillars of git(please doble check ur understanding)
1-commit(code at that time)
2-tree(maintains the structure)
3-blob(here it is the enetire code)

this is the flow
commit contains info about the tree
which contains info about blob
which contains info about the code(actual content)
