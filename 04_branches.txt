branches are nothing but deviation from main branch

there is something called main and branches are deviation
from main it can like client side hustle etc
and the fun fact is that they do not effect each other

head is nothing but something which points current branch which
is nothing but top of the stack
use git log --oneline to check the stuff

to know branches
git branch 


to create one
git branch branchName

to switch 
git switch branchName

to create and go in one shot
git switch -c branchName 


to merge different branches
git merge b1(now you are in main)

after this the same file exist in both the place

now something crazy is coming to the picture what if when you
overwrite the content in two branches
'
and you have to call git merge everytime when you want to merge
