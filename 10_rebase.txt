first lets understand what is rebase
ok

first you have developed a branch to write a function
and at the same time some another developer is
working on the main

and they went on and now you want to link the newly
created branch to main instead of joining
them at the main we king of shift the base itself

version1->branch1

now version1->branch1,(version2->version3)
now what we do here is
now version1->,(version2->version3)->branch1


now look iam writing this after making changes
in the rebase branch okay


now making changes for rebase2
lets build that

git reflog to see everything precisely
